# How to Use This Application
## Setup
This project works with Python 3.8.1., so make a Python virtual environment:
`python3.8 -m venv venv`
Then, activate this virtual env and install the required Python packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Finally, run the tests:
`pytest`
## Development
In addition to the previous steps, install packages that help with developing this project:
`pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`
To check if code follows pep8 guidelines, run
`flake8 --exclude=venv/* --max-line-length=110`
To automatically and uniformly format the code,
`black . --line-length=110 -S --exclude=venv/`
# Assumptions
The API under test makes no assumptions about the attributes of objects like `post`. In real systems, the backend usually checks to see if the provided object has all the required attributes and my tests take this into account.
Below are my specification of what attributes each object must have.
For example, if I try to edit a `post` object with a payload like {'random_attr': 'blah'}, then the backend should return an error such as "400 Bad Request".
## `post` Object Attributes
Create `post` calls must have all these attributes:
- title
- body
- userId
Edit `post` calls must have one or more of these attributes:
- title
- body
- userId
